<h4 class="pt-5 text-danger text-start">What is a Learning Management System? How is it useful?</h4>
<p class=" text-start">A learning management system, (LMS) is software that is designed specifically to create, distribute, and manage the delivery of educational content. 
The LMS can be hosted as a stand-alone product on the company server, or it can be a cloud-based platform that is hosted by the software firm.</p>

<p> Think of a learning management system as a technology that can improve learning, make it faster, productive, cost-effective, and what is more important – trackable.</p>
<p>The most basic LMS contains a core functional platform that enables administrators to upload learning content, deliver lessons to students, serve notifications, and share data with authorized users.</p>
<p>An LMS most often operates inside of a web-browser, behind a secure sign-on process. This gives all students and instructors easy access to courses on-the-go, while administrators and leaders can monitor student progress and make improvements.</p>

<h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start">Types of Learning Management Systems (LMS)</h4>
 <p class=" text-start">There are several types of learning management systems that organizations can choose from, check the comparison list:</p>
 <p>Enterprise vs. Individual<br/>
Free vs. Commercial<br/>

Cloud-based vs. On-premise<br/>
Integrated<br/>
Built-in Authoring Tools or Pre-Written CMS</p>


<h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start">What Does an LMS Do?</h4>

 <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start">The advantages of LMS in any educational setting can include:
</h4>
 <p class="text-start">Teachers can use established pedagogical models to deliver more personalized lessons and increase the engagement level of students
Students respond well to micro-learning and the LMS is a perfect platform for facilitating this format of learning
Students can learn on their own via computers, laptops, and mobile devices to keep learning alive 24/7
An LMS increases the flexibility and creativity of the learning materials, which enhances the student experience and encourages shared collaboration
Student progression through lessons and assessments becomes more self-driven — tapping into the natural way humans learn

<h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start">How to Select the Best LMS for Your Organization?</h4>
 <p class="text-start">It’s important to understand how to choose the best LMS for your organizational purposes.</p>

 <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start"> - Measurable results</h4>
 <p class="text-start">Investing in learning management software for your organization often comes down to how quickly you can measure real results. If it’s for business purposes, for example, to train employees, 
 being able to quickly and effectively produce high levels of proficiency matters.</p>

 <p>These results should be displayed for users (as in completion rates, steps towards goals) as well as administrators in terms of completed modules, scores, and the connection to corporate objectives.</p>

 <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start"> - Accessibility and User-friendly Design</h4>
 <p class="text-start">A major issue that can make or break a learning management system is when there are accessibility issues for users. The sign-on process should be simple and secure. 
 The home screen should be intuitive and include the information that a user needs to start completing courses.</p>
 <p>In addition, tools such as AI and chatbots can enable learners to search for and find new course suggestions matched to their interests. 
     This is especially important when working with younger people or multi-generational learners who may not be accustomed to the latest formats.</p>
 <p>Fonts and layout of content should be in a user-friendly design, and all text needs to be translatable to other language types and 508 compliant.</p>

 <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start"> - Adaptability</h4>
 <p class="text-start">Today, learners need to be able to take their learning on-the-go. 
 Therefore a multi-device LMS can ensure that learners can access their courses and pick up where they’ve left off anytime it suits them.</p>

 <p>With a vast majority of the population accessing the Internet via mobile devices now worldwide,
      the LMS you choose must be able to work well on a variety of operational systems, browsers, and screen sizes.</p>
 
 <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start"> - Secure data management</h4>
 <p class="text-start">When an organization wants to develop and manage courses, a secure LMS platform is a must. 
     Not only is course data proprietary in nature, but the information of all users needs to be protected.</p>

<p>Only select an LMS that has a single sign-on process (SSO) and maintains information behind added layers of security linked to user privileges. 
    This is especially important when using a cloud-based server to house data.</p>

     <h4 class="py-4 text-danger text-start"> - Support response and training</h4>
 <p class="text-start">Before deciding on the best LMS for your organization, consider that there will be times when live customer support will be needed.
  This often happens during the implementation and integration phases, but it can arise anytime.</p>
