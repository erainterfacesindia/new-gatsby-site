                    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is at the epicenter of the Digital Transformation Revolution that is changing the shape of business, enterprise and people’s lives. 
                        This transformation influences everything from how we manage and operate our homes to automating processes across nearly all industries. 
                        Provides businesses and people better insight into and control over objects and environments that are currently beyond the reach of the internet. 
                        By doing so, IoT helps businesses and people to be more connected to the world around them and to do more meaningful, higher-level work.
                         IoT is smarter than the Internet. <br/>
                     According to numbers from the Improving Internet of Things (IoT) Security with Software-Defined Network (SDN) study,
                         there will be more than 75.44 billion connected IoT devices by 2025. With a forecast of over 7.33 billion mobile users by 2023 and more than 1,105 million connected wearable devices users by 2022, 
                         the Internet of Things is expected to grow into one of the smartest collective and collaborative systems in history.
                    <br/>
                    The COE intends to drive students towards path-breaking innovation in emerging technologies by bridging the gap between academia & industry trends. 
                    We focus on solving real-world challenges utilizing emerging Industry 4.0 technologies like IoT, AI etc. Consistent, productive engagement with students stands as unique proposition w.r.t other existing CoEs
