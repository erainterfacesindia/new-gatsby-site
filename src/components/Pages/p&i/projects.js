We aim to fill the critical skill gap between the academia curriculum and fast changing industry. In our agreements with various colleges and universities we noticed after the students completion of a project and internship initiative. 
                              They were able to secure jobs easily and started their endeavours in domains which the curriculum could not provide.</p>  
                              <p>Some of the subjects our mentors teach are App Development, IoT development, full stack development, Django/Python, Cyber Security, Data Science, Wordpress/ Frontend Development, 
                                Artificial intelligence/Machine learning, Blockchain, UI/UX Design, Flutter Development, IoT Development and much more</p>
